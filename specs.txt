Specifications for RepeatCounter


1   Take a single letter input as the main string and the matching single letter
    input for the search query.  This input is the simplest possible case because
    it is a single character, not repeated. Return a repeat count of one.

    Main string: "a"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"


2   Take a single letter input that does not match the search query, to show that
    a non-match will return a repeat count of zero.

    Main string: "a"
    Search query: "b"
    Output: "Repeats: 0"


3   Take a capital letter as the main string and a lowercase match in the search
    query to show to case sensitivity does not matter in the simplest case.

    Main string: "A"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"


4   Take a two character input as the main string and a single character search
    query matching one in the main string.  This test will show that a partial
    match of the search query will not be counted as a repeat.

    Main string: "ab"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 0"


5   Take a two repeating character input in the main string with no spaces, and
    the same single character as the search query.  This test will show that a
    repeating partial match will not be counted.

    Main string: "aa"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 0"


6   Take a two character spaced input as the main string and a matching single
    character as the search query.  This will show that repeated matches will
    be counted.

    Main string: "a a"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 2"


7   Take two different characters, spaced as the main string and matching
    character as the search query.  This will show that a match and non-match
    can be identified independently.

    Main string: "a b"
    Search query:  "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"


7   Take a three character spaced input with two matches to the search query,
    showing that a non-match and a repeated match can be identified individually.

    Main string: "a z a"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 2"


8   Take a full word as the main input and the matching word as the search query,
    show that multi-character recognition is working.

    Main string: "Equal"
    Search string: "Equal"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"


9   Take two different words as the main string and a match in the search query,
    showing that full word matches and non-matches can be identified individually.

    Main string: "Not equal"
    Search query: "equal"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"


10  Take a phrase with some repeated words as the main string and one of those
    words as the search query.  This shows that multiple matches of full words
    are counted correctly.

    Main string: "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood"
    Search query: "woodchuck"
    Output: "Repeats: 2"

11  Take a phrase with some repeated words and partial matches as the main
    string and one of those words as the search query.  This shows that multiple
    matches of full words are counted correctly, and partial matches are ignored.

    Main string: "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood"
    Search query: "wood"
    Output: "Repeats: 2"
