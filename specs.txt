Specifications for RepeatCounter


1   Take a single letter input as the main string and the matching single letter
    input for the search query.  This input is the simplest possible case because
    it is a single character, not repeated. Return a repeat count of one.

    Main string: "a"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"

2   Take a single letter input that does not match the search query, to show that
    a non-match will return a repeat count of zero.

    Main string: "a"
    Search query: "b"
    Output: "Repeats: 0"


3   Take a capital letter as the main string and a lowercase match in the search
    query to show to case sensitivity does not matter in the simplest case.

    Main string: "A"
    Search query: "a"
    Output: "Repeats: 1"
